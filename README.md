# ADMN5016-SimranD
My Repository of files for our ADMN 5016 class.
All files related to my final project are uploaded here.
I made a change and chose a similar but simpler and different set of test and training data, as I found the original datasets too complicated to work with. This new data set is in the "Updated Machine Learning Dataset" folder.

The submission on Blackboard only contains my AI app, the datsets as well as my explanation of the value of the model is contained here in this repository.

Finally, As noted in my code comments and my PDF here; I was unable to complete this project, no excuses- I simply fell behind and didnt dedicate enough timee here to be honest. I ran into an error I could not resolve, so my app is not actually complete, and I am simply submitting what I have for whatever partial marks I can potentially get here.
